Property Admin Dashboard (Property Owner Panel)
This dashboard is for property owners (Property Admins) to manage their listings and view related bookings. It will be a restricted area that only authenticated users with the “Property Admin” role can access. Key features include:
Property Management (CRUD): The ability to Add New Property, Edit Property Details, and Delete Property listings. Each property would have fields like title, description, location, photos, pricing, availability, etc. The UI can present a form for inputting property info and uploading images. After submission, a new document in Firestore (e.g. under a properties collection) is created with an owner reference (owner’s UID). Edits update that document, and deletion either soft-deletes or removes it.
Booking Management: A section to view all bookings for that owner’s properties. This can be presented as a filterable list or calendar view of upcoming and past reservations. Each booking entry shows details like guest name, dates, payment status, etc. The property admin should be able to update the booking status (e.g. mark as “confirmed”, “checked-in” or cancel a booking if necessary), but only for their own properties. They might also contact the guest if needed (e.g. view guest contact info or message via the app).
Analytics & Feedback (Optional): To empower property owners, the dashboard could show simple analytics like total bookings this month, occupancy rate, or earnings for their properties. Additionally, owners could view guest reviews/ratings for their properties and respond to feedback. This helps owners improve their listings and service quality.

UI/UX Design: The dashboard will be a responsive web interface built with React and Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern look. Use a sidebar or top navigation for sections like Dashboard Home, My Properties, Bookings, and Profile. For example, the “My Properties” page shows a list of the owner’s properties in cards or a table format (with key info like title, location, status). Each item has action buttons (Edit, Delete). An “Add Property” button leads to a form page or modal. The “Bookings” page can list bookings grouped by property or date; using Tailwind utility classes, we can style status badges (e.g. upcoming, completed) and highlight important info. Ensure the interface is intuitive – e.g. using modal dialogs for confirming deletions, and success messages/snackbars on successful edits. Data Security & Separation: It is crucial that a property admin only accesses their own data. We enforce this in the data model by storing the owner’s UID on each property and booking record. For example, each property document might have an ownerId field, and each booking has a propertyId and perhaps propertyOwnerId. Then, apply Firestore Security Rules to restrict access: e.g. allow reading/writing a property only if request.auth.uid == resource.data.ownerId. Similarly, allow a property admin to fetch bookings only where propertyOwnerId == request.auth.uid. Using Firebase Auth’s custom claims can help here – when a user is granted “PropertyAdmin” role, a claim can store their role, and security rules can check auth.token.role == 'PropertyAdmin' for certain privileges​

. However, even without custom claims, per-document rules using the ownerId fields will ensure owners cannot touch others’ data. This guarantees each owner has full control of their data only, as required. We’ll also enforce in the React app by filtering queries (e.g. query only properties where ownerId == currentUserId), but the primary protection is at the database rule level.
