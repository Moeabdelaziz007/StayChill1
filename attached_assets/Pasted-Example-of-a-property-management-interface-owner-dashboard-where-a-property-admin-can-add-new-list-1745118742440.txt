Example of a property management interface (owner dashboard) where a property admin can add new listings and edit existing properties. The dashboard provides forms for property details and a list of current listings with edit/delete options.

UI/UX Design: The dashboard will be a responsive web interface built with React and Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern look. Use a sidebar or top navigation for sections like Dashboard Home, My Properties, Bookings, and Profile. For example, the “My Properties” page shows a list of the owner’s properties in cards or a table format (with key info like title, location, status). Each item has action buttons (Edit, Delete). An “Add Property” button leads to a form page or modal. The “Bookings” page can list bookings grouped by property or date; using Tailwind utility classes, we can style status badges (e.g. upcoming, completed) and highlight important info. Ensure the interface is intuitive – e.g. using modal dialogs for confirming deletions, and success messages/snackbars on successful edits.

Data Security & Separation: It is crucial that a property admin only accesses their own data. We enforce this in the data model by storing the owner’s UID on each property and booking record. For example, each property document might have an ownerId field, and each booking has a propertyId and perhaps propertyOwnerId. Then, apply Firestore Security Rules to restrict access: e.g. allow reading/writing a property only if request.auth.uid == resource.data.ownerId. Similarly, allow a property admin to fetch bookings only where propertyOwnerId == request.auth.uid. Using Firebase Auth’s custom claims can help here – when a user is granted “PropertyAdmin” role, a claim can store their role, and security rules can check auth.token.role == 'PropertyAdmin' for certain privileges ￼. However, even without custom claims, per-document rules using the ownerId fields will ensure owners cannot touch others’ data. This guarantees each owner has full control of their data only, as required. We’ll also enforce in the React app by filtering queries (e.g. query only properties where ownerId == currentUserId), but the primary protection is at the database rule level.
